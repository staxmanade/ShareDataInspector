Share Data Inspector
--


The Share Data Inspector provides a deep dive into what data is being shared when you click on the share charm (Win+h keyboard shortcut) from within nearly any Windows 8 application. This tool can be used to understand the different types of data shared and provides a way to visualize the data. Whether the third party application is sharing HTML, Text, Storage Files, or a Bitmap, this tool will give you insight into what data an application is sharing.

This application may download content from external sources. The Share Data Inspector leverages internet access for the case another app shares an HTML data type. When inspecting the data shared with the app through the Windows 8 Share Charm, we render the HTML in a web view and internet access can be useful for displaying images etc within the shared HTML.
